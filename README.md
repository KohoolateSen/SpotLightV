## Description : 
A simple Telegram bot powered primarily by a GPT model, with features that are enhanced by AI capabilities! Perhaps even combined!

You can also create your own sub-module within the DSM (which supersedes the core module), using AI models provided by GPT4Free. For instance, a Telegram group moderator equipped with word recognition abilities can identify abusive language and issue warnings!

As an initial step, I've already developed a sub-module called "NewsReader." It's currently under development, and the primary functionality is to collect news by scraping news websites and retrieving queries via an API. There is still some work to be done, such as implementing translation abilities for this module.

In summary, I hope this project will be beneficial overall!

## Installation & Setup :
1. Get an telegram bot API token from bot father.
2. Get an NewsAPI token from newsapi.org website.
3. Place API tokens at config.ini . ( You can also change other default parameters )
4. pip install -r requirements.txt
5. execute main.py
